If you type mongo in the terminal, you get something like command mongo not found


1. Open /usr/local/bin

   Copy the binaries from mongodb/bin, to /usr/local/bin.



2. Open the .bashrc file and add 

   export PATH=<mongodb-install-directory>/mongodb/bin:$PATH 

   line in the end.

3. I failed at the step 2, I try to write this line into .bashrc_profile using terminal

   echo 'export PATH=/Users/frida/mongodb/bin:$PATH' >>~/.bash_profile
   
   This can help to write path into .bash_profile without opening that profile.
