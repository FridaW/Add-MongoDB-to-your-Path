If you type mongo in the terminal, you get something like command mongo not found




1. Open the .bashrc file and add 

   export PATH=<mongodb-install-directory>/mongodb/bin:$PATH 

   line in the end.

2. I failed at the step 2, I try to write this line into .bashrc_profile using terminal

   echo 'export PATH=/Users/frida/mongodb/bin:$PATH' >>~/.bash_profile
   
   This can help to write path into .bash_profile without opening that profile.
